= 3. How To Use Autumn =
Using Autumn framework to program include six steps.
== 3.1. Write POCO ==
POCO means Plain Old C++ Object. Because Autumn is not invasive to your old code, so you can write your classes as before. Don't inherit from some classes, nor include some friendly memebers.
== 3.2. Create bean wrapper ==
In Autumn, we call classes beans(like Spring). If a bean has properties to be injected or is injected to other bean as a property, we must create a wrapper for it using the macros that are defined in head file _BeanWrapperMacro.h_.
== 3.3. Write main program ==
== 3.4. Compile program ==
== 3.5. Write configuration file ==
== 3.6. Run program ==
