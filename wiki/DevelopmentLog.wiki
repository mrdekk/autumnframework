impement factory pattern:
  * instance factory: use "factory-bean" attribute of bean.
  * static factory method: one bean support only one factory method.

== 03/12/2007 ==
implement instance factory pattern. Tested on VC6. I used a simple way to get it: pass factory instance to bean wrapper->createBean as a constructor argument, and define it as a argument also. I will add <factory-bean> tag in schema.

== 03/06/2007 ==

fix three bugs:
  * don't close dynamic libraries when exiting progress.
  * don't free TypeManager when free BeanFactory.
  * a dead loop in TypeManager->isCustomized() function.

== 03/05/2007 ==
  * release 0.1.0 version.
